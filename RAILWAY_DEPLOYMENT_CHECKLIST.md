# Railway Deployment Checklist ✅

## Pre-Deployment Requirements
- [x] GitHub repository updated with Railway configs
- [x] Health check endpoint implemented
- [x] Production package.json created
- [x] Railway configuration files added
- [x] Environment variables documented

## Step-by-Step Railway Deployment

### 1. Create Railway Account
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app/)
2. Sign up using your GitHub account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Deploy from GitHub
1. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Select your `telegram-bot` repository
3. Railway will automatically detect Node.js project

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
**CRITICAL**: Add these in Railway Dashboard > Variables:

```env
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID=your_channel_id_here
METAAPI_TOKEN=your_metaapi_token_here
METAAPI_ACCOUNT_ID=your_metaapi_account_id_here
TEST_MODE=false
LOG_LEVEL=info
NODE_ENV=production
```

### 4. Deployment Settings
- **Build Command**: `npm run railway:build`
- **Start Command**: `npm run railway:start`
- **Health Check**: `/health` endpoint
- **Port**: Will use Railway's `PORT` environment variable

### 5. Monitor Deployment
1. Check build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Verify health check endpoint responds
3. Monitor application logs for errors
4. Test bot functionality in Telegram

## Resource Limits (Free Tier)
- ✅ **500 execution hours/month** (covers 24/7 operation for ~20 days)
- ✅ **1GB RAM** (sufficient for Node.js bot)
- ✅ **1GB disk space** (adequate for logs and dependencies)
- ✅ **Automatic SSL** (HTTPS endpoints included)

## Production Monitoring
- **Health Check URL**: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- **Logs**: Available in Railway dashboard
- **Uptime**: Monitor via health endpoint
- **Resource Usage**: Track in Railway metrics

## Post-Deployment Testing
1. **Bot Responsiveness**: Send test message to configured channel
2. **OCR Processing**: Upload trading screenshot to verify parsing
3. **Trade Execution**: Confirm MetaAPI orders are placed correctly
4. **Error Handling**: Check logs for any deployment-specific issues

## Backup Plan
If Railway free tier limits exceeded:
- **Oracle Cloud**: Always Free tier available
- **Heroku**: 550 hours/month free
- **Render**: 750 hours/month free

## Environment Variable Security
- ✅ Never commit actual tokens to git
- ✅ Use Railway's encrypted variable storage
- ✅ Production tokens different from development
- ✅ Regularly rotate API keys

## Success Indicators
- [x] Application builds successfully
- [x] Health check returns 200 OK
- [x] Bot connects to Telegram API
- [x] MetaAPI connection established
- [x] OCR processing functional
- [x] Trade signals processed correctly
